# Adaptive-Landmark-based-Spectral-Clustering-ALSC-
In this section, an algorithm for determining the optimal number of clusters (kopt) is proposed. This number (kopt) is used in the clustering of an input big dataset. This algorithm is referred to as the ALSC algorithm. The proposed algorithm comprises three phases and uses parallel processing to speed up its performance. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm are determining the optimal number of clusters and producing high clustering accuracy with the identification of the number of clusters.
